        The VisionX Lab (Vision and eXtended) Lab is affiliated with Wuhan University. Our research spans three key areas:<br>
        1. Vision Perception: Our research encompasses various computer vision fields, including object detection, image parsing, and human activity recognition, and other fundamental aspects of computer vision.<br>
        2. Vision-Language Integration: We are dedicated to facilitating seamless collaboration between vision and language, enhancing communication and reasoning across these modalities.<br>
        3. Generative Models: We aim to generate high-fidelity images, text, and other forms of content, fostering new possibilities in AI-driven content generation.<br>
