abstract: Although deep neural networks have been proved effective in many
  applications, they are data hungry and training deep models often requires
  laboriously labeled data. However, when labeled data contain erroneous labels,
  they often lead to model performance degradation. A common solution is to
  assign each sample with a dynamic weight during optimization, and the weight
  is adjusted in accordance with the loss. However, those weights are usually
  unreliable since they are measured by the losses of corrupted labels. Thus,
  this scheme might impede the discriminative ability of neural networks trained
  on noisy data. To address this issue, we propose a novel reweighting method,
  dubbed self-reweighting from class centroids (SRCC), by assigning sample
  weights based on the similarities between the samples and our online learned
  class centroids. Since we exploit statistical class centers in the image
  feature space to reweight data samples in learning, our method is robust to
  noise caused by corrupted labels. In addition, even after reweighting the
  noisy data, the decision boundaries might still suffer distortions. Thus, we
  leverage mixed inputs that are generated by linearly interpolating two random
  images and their labels to further regularize the boundaries. We employ the
  learned class centroids to evaluate the conﬁdence of our generated mixed data
  via measuring feature similarities. During the network optimization, the class
  centroids are updated as more discriminative feature representations of
  original images are learned. In doing so, SRCC will generate more robust
  weighting coefﬁcients for noisy and mixed data, and facilitates our feature
  representation learning in return. Extensive experiments on both the synthetic
  and real image recognition tasks demonstrate that our method SRCC outperforms
  the state-of-the-art on learning with noisy data.
