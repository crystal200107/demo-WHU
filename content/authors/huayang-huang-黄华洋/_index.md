I’m Huayang Huang, currently a third-year master’s student at School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan University. My academic journey has been a rewarding exploration of AI Security, with a particular focus on generative models. Previously, my research interests centered on backdoor attacks and defenses. Outside of academia, I’m an avid badminton player and a music enthusiast, with a passion for playing the piano and ukulele. I’m also constantly exploring new musical instruments！
