I am an undergraduate, majoring in computer science and technology in Wuhan university of technology. In the past three years, I have achieved great academic performance. My academic score ranks the second in my major (2/212), and my GPA is 4.387/5. I have also won the honorary title of national scholarship. What’s more, I attach importance to English learning, and my scores of CET4 and CET6 both exceed 600.\
With regard to my competition and scientific research experience, I have participated many times in mathematical modeling contests, in which I have strengthen my capability of solving mathematical problems with algorithm and paper writing in latex. And in Service Outsourcing Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition, I’ve learned the basic knowledge of object recognition and grown the capability of adjusting neural network's structure. Besides, I’ve self-taught Linux-related knowledge and Java-web-related knowledge in my spare time. All these enable me to be a person with comprehensive skills.
