I am Yu Wu (武宇), a Full Professor at School of Computer Science, Wuhan University. Before that I was a postdoc at [Visual AI Lab, Princeton University](https://visualai.princeton.edu/) from 2021 to 2022. I received my Ph.D. at the ReLER Lab, University of Technology Sydney, advised by [Prof.Yi Yang](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/yi.yang/). I received the B.Eng degree in Mechanical Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Here are my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=23SZHUwAAAAJ) and [CV](https://yu-wu.net/pdf/Resume_Yu_Wu.pdf).
